# Projects
Programming projects done at school. The Python project was done in the first year in group of two,
to learn basics of Tkinter and OO programming in Python. It was graded 190/200  which one might
consider a surprise looking at the code.
The programs done in C++ were done in the second year, where the game15 is a bit smaller program to
learn basics for OO programming, and usage of vectors, with C++. Tetris was the final project of the
course, and includes OOP, GUI design and usage of QT Designer, and using different data structures.
The Tetris project was graded 42/50. For both of these projects, a base was given to program upon.
