# Projects
Programming projects done at school. The Python project was done in the first year in group of two,
to learn basics of Tkinter and OO programming in Python. It was graded 190/200  which one might
consider a surprise looking at the code.

The programs done in C++ were done in the second and third year, where the game15 is a bit smaller program to learn basics for OO programming, and usage of vectors. Tetris was the final project of the course, and includes OOP, GUI design and usage of QT Designer, and using different data structures. The Tetris project was graded 42/50. For both of these projects, a template was given.
The Nysse project was done in third year with a peer. It was the sole project on the course, as the target was to learn working as a part of a team on a larger software project. It combines GUI design and implementation to an exsisting application, applying and following design by contract, and exception handling and error control. Thus, an extensive template was given. More information can be found in the README in the project folder.
