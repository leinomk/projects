This is the larger software project done in third year, as part of the course Programming 3: Techniques. The pre-existing code given as the base for the project, is in the Course directory. 

The project output is a game, where the player aims to destroy buses, stops and passengers which are in either one of the previous, to get points, while driving a helicopter around with WASD-keys, and dropping bombs by pressing SPACE.

While the rest of the project is probably of adequate quality, the unit tests are not that good, since the class they are supposed to test ended up having relatively small importance and implementation in our project.

When running the game, it is recommendable to use low resolution screen/settings, since the game window is rather small in high resolution.

And yes, we did find the bug related to selecting difficulty level, as one can effectively select 0 if no change to the dialogue input is made before accepting it, but decided to leave it as a meta-level fun feature.
